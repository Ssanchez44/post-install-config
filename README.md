This ensures that your team members can only perform actions relevant to their responsibilities. </p> <br /> <p> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e760d4b0-b117-45d6-b2ad-3936d2affd62" alt="Departments image" /> </p> <p> By using departments, you can ensure that tickets are routed to the appropriate team. </p> <p> This ensures that your agents only see the tickets they are responsible for. Additionally, each department can be customized according to its specific needs. </p> <p> For instance, you can create separate departments for "Technical Support," "Sales," or "Billing," each with their own set of agents and ticket management rules. </p> <br /> <p> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d04d729-57a6-4835-8eb9-463a57df0759" alt="Teams image" /> </p> <p> Teams in osTicket allow you to organize your agents into functional groups. </p> <p> This approach helps assign specific tasks and responsibilities to each group. For example, you could create a "Technical Support" team, a "Billing" team, and a "Sales" team. </p> <p> By doing this, tickets can be routed to the right group based on the help topic, making ticket management more efficient. </p> <br /> <p> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17073eed-e58f-4bf1-bcf1-872b07bb0c77" alt="Agents image" /> </p> <p> Agents (workers) are a critical part of the osTicket system, as they are responsible for managing and resolving customer support tickets. </p> <p> You can assign agents to specific departments and teams to ensure they handle the tickets relevant to their expertise. </p> <p> Each agent can also have different permissions based on their roles, determining whether they can edit tickets, view reports, or manage system settings. </p> <br /> <p> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fc9f083-0c16-4e56-bbcf-e6dcdce2fa0c" alt="Users image" /> </p> <p> In osTicket, users (customers) are people who submit support tickets. </p> <p> You can manage users by adding their details manually, allowing them to register and submit tickets via the web portal, or through email. </p> <p> Once added, you can assign them to the relevant departments and help topics, ensuring their tickets are routed correctly. </p> <br /> <p> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42ee5c32-99bb-4dd1-9e9d-ee10776fb456" alt="SLA image" /> </p> <p> SLA (Service Level Agreements) Plans allow you to set different rules for response and resolution times based on ticket priority or type. </p> <p> For example, you can create an SLA plan where high-priority tickets must be responded to within 1 hour, and low-priority tickets must be addressed within 24 hours. </p> <p> This helps ensure timely support for urgent issues and allows you to track agent performance based on SLA compliance. </p> <br /> <p> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5afc3001-cc1e-4d5c-b98f-3492bdeaacde" alt="Help Topics image" /> </p> <p> Help Topics are categories that help organize and classify the types of support tickets being submitted by users. </p> <p> By using help topics, you can guide users to select the appropriate category for their issue, ensuring that tickets are automatically routed to the right department or team. </p> <p> This makes it easier for agents to address specific issues without unnecessary delays. </p> <br />

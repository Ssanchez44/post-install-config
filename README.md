<p>
  Using roles and permissions in osTicket gives you the flexibility to control what each user or agent can access and modify within the system.

</p>
<p>
By using departments, you can ensure that tickets are routed to the appropriate team, that your agents only see the tickets they are responsible for, and that each department can be customized according to its specific needs.

</p>
<p>
This approach allows you to organize your agents into functional teams, assign them specific tasks, and ensure that tickets are routed to the right group.

</p>
<p>
Agents (workers) are a critical part of the osTicket system, as they are responsible for managing and resolving customer support tickets.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
In osTicket, users (customers) are people who submit support tickets, and you can manage them by adding their details, allowing them to register and submit tickets via the web portal or email, and assigning them to appropriate departments or tickets.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
SLA Plans allow you to set different rules for response and resolution times based on ticket priority or type.
You can create multiple SLA plans with different conditions for response and resolution times, like 1 hour for high-priority tickets or 24 hours for low-priority tickets.
